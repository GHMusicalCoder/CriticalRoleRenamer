# CriticalRoleRenamer
Rename my Critical Role files

This started out as a simple file renamer for my Critical Role downloads from youtube (I wanted to hear them via my podcast client, instead of watching them on youtube, so I grabbed them and stripped the audio out), so this would grab the episode title, and nubmer, and reformat to my liking

This will probably be modified as I'm sure I'll find additional uses for it
